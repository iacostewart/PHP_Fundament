<?php 

// php has a lot of prebuilt string functions.. like 98 of them.. so we will only
// look at these.. cause dont no one have time for that. 
$curency = 'penny';

$sampleString = 'A penny saved is a penny earned.';
echo $sampleString;

// this will print out like we always have 

$sampleString = 'A $curency saved is a $curency earned.';
// this will echo out the string as it is listed above. /
// if we wanted to include the variables into the string to save time
// 

// what if we need to include the quotes in our echo 
// we need to use the / infront of the single quote.. this is called an escape character.
